# full-stack-inventory-project
1. Project Overview  The Full-Stack Inventory Management System is designed to automate and optimize business operations related to product management, purchasing, sales, expenses, returns, and reporting. The system integrates back-end APIs, database-driven modules, and a structured front-end to deliver a scalable and user-friendly solution for managing inventory lifecycles.  The project emphasizes modular development, API-first architecture, Postman testing for validation, and front-end strategy for usability.  2. Project Objectives  Automate product, purchase, sales, and return management.  Provide real-time expense and business reporting.  Ensure secure user authentication and role-based access.  Build scalable APIs for business-critical operations.  Deliver a clean front-end with dashboard and reporting features.  3. Project Scope In-Scope Features  User & Authentication:  User creation, login, token generation, email utilities.  Role-based permissions.  Master Data Management:  Brand, category, product, suppliers, and customer modules.  CRUD operations with Postman-tested APIs.  Expense & Financials:  Expense type and transaction management.  Expense reports, creation, update, and deletion.  Purchases & Sales:  Purchase models with parent-child service design.  Sales and purchase return handling.  Transaction rollback and error management.  CRUD for purchase and sales modules.  Reporting & Dashboard:  Business reports, expense reports, and summary dashboards.  Report handling for purchases, sales, and returns.  Front-End Development:  Strategy and package selection (React/Angular/Vue).  File and folder structure setup.  Customer-facing UI for CRUD and reports.  Out of Scope (for initial phase)  Advanced analytics (AI-driven demand forecasting).  Multi-currency or multi-language support.  Mobile application development.  4. Technical Architecture  Back-End: Node.js + Express.js (REST API)  Database: MongoDB (with schema models for modular entities)  Front-End: React.js (modular structure with reusable components)  Testing: Postman (API validation & integration testing)  Authentication: JWT-based token authentication with email verification  Deployment: Cloud hosting (Render/Heroku/AWS)  5. Development Strategy  Backend First Approach  Establish database models and relations.  Implement services and controllers.  Validate APIs with Postman.  Iterative Module Development  Start with core modules: users, products, categories, brands.  Extend to suppliers, customers, purchases, and sales.  Add expense and reporting functionalities.  Frontend Integration  Setup project structure.  Develop forms for CRUD operations.  Implement dashboards and reports.  Testing & Debugging  Unit testing for services.  API testing with Postman.  Bug fixing and rollback mechanism.  6. Project Deliverables  Functional APIs for all modules (users, products, expenses, purchases, sales, returns).  Postman collection with tested endpoints.  A responsive front-end with dashboard and CRUD features.  Business and expense reports with downloadable/export options.  Documentation (API reference, user manual, developer guide).  7. Project Benefits  Streamlined purchase and sales operations.  Centralized management of inventory and expenses.  Improved decision-making through reporting.  Scalable system design for future enhancements.  Reduced manual errors via automation.  8. Future Enhancements  Role-based dashboards (Admin, Manager, Staff).  Real-time order tracking and notifications.  Barcode/QR code integration for products.  Advanced reporting with visualization tools (charts/graphs).  Integration with third-party accounting software.
